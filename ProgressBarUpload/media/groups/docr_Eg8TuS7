--Deep learning
-recurrent neural network(rnn)-RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs.
-tenserflow
-sequence to sequence learning
-convutional neural network
-lstm
	Numerous researchers now use a deep learning RNN called the long short-term memory (LSTM) network
	LSTM RNNs prevent backpropagated errors from vanishing or exploding

-Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Theano features:
	
    tight integration with NumPy – Use numpy.ndarray in Theano-compiled functions.
    transparent use of a GPU – Perform data-intensive calculations up to 140x faster than with CPU.(float32 only)
    efficient symbolic differentiation – Theano does your derivatives for function with one or many inputs.
    speed and stability optimizations – Get the right answer for log(1+x) even when x is really tiny.
    dynamic C code generation – Evaluate expressions faster.
    extensive unit-testing and self-verification – Detect and diagnose many types of errors.


-supervised learning::collecting training data->train classifier(like a function)->make predictions
	classifier(box of rules)
	scikit-learn uses real-valued features not string
	pip install numpy,scipy,sklearn


-semantic ambiguity(same name problems like cat and kitty)

-better way to write tenserflow program is tflearn
	tflearn
		high levek ml library
		syntax similar to scikit learn
